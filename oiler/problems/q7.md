# 7. HMAC

The [HMAC-SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC#Examples) value is commonly used to sign inputs (such as HTTP requests) with a secret key to ensure they aren't tampered with in transit.

The hmac-sha256 based "signature" of the text `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`, with the key `key`, and encoded using a [base64 URL-safe encoding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5), is:

```

```

What are the equivalent signatures for these inputs? (one input per line, one signature per line):

```
